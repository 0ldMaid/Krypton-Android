Hi everyone. I have been working on my new cryptocurrency for the last year now and I'm about ready to test it. I'm wondering if there are any volunteers out there that are willing to help. You can now download the program here. I will be giving away tokens to experienced users on this forum. Check it out and tell me what you think.

This has been tested but there still could be bugs report them to me if you come across anything.

Originally the project started as a peer to peer selling tool like Magento for your desktop. That project was called LiteMarket. After feedback from users on some Bitcoin forums I realized very few people have the knowledge to set something like that up and they don't want to download something new. So I rebuilt the project inline with Bitcoin blockchain tech instead.
The idea is that each coin is actually a set of information like an ad listing on eBay or Amazon. You can update your listing(s) with your private key like Bitcoin and everyone can view the listings through the client or on the web. So it's more like a decentralized craigslist then anything else. I call them Krypton coins as a play on the Superman idea and also Krypton like Crypto. Unlike openbazaar it does not have any sale support it's not an eBay. It's a way for people to post ad listings online for whatever they want and if customers want to buy, the payment would be arranged by the seller and Bitcoin. I hope to make a subreddit about this but my account doesn't have enough karma yet.

The project is written from scratch using Java so there is potential of building android nodes down the line, the system could be completely mobile based.

If anyone wants to you can check out the TOR feed right now you can go to the link below. Each node can display it's info into the tor network for anyone on the system to see. So you don't need the program to view the stuff for sale.
